    <h1>How did the species die out?</h1>
   
  <p>The Wooly Mammoth died due to <b>climate change</b> as it <b>adapted</b> 
      to the cold weathers and climate change wiped everything out and due to <b>human hunting</b> 
      for shelter clothing and for tools also to the fact that they were
      <b>lacking food and habitat</b></p><br>

  <h1>Diet of a Wooly Mammoth</h1>

  <p>Woolly mammoths were <b>herbivores</b> that grazed primarily on tough <b>tundra grasses and sedges,</b> 
    using their tusks to dig under snow, but also ate <b>flowering plants, shrubs, mosses, and tree materials,</b>
    consuming massive amounts up to <b>400-500 lbs daily</b> and spending most of their day foraging in the
    Cold Steppe ecosystem. Their complex stomach and ridged molars helped them digest these fibrous
    plants, with diet varying by location and season.</p><br>
