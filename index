    <h3>How did the species die out?</h3>
   
  <p>The Wooly Mammoth died due to <b>climate change</b> as it <b>adapted</b> 
      to the cold weathers and climate change wiped everything out and due to <b>human hunting</b> 
      for shelter clothing and for tools also to the fact that they were
      <b>lacking food and habitat.</b></p><br>

  <h3>Diet of a Wooly Mammoth</h3>

  <p>Woolly mammoths were <b>herbivores</b> that grazed primarily on tough <b>tundra grasses and sedges,</b> 
    using their tusks to dig under snow, but also ate <b>flowering plants, shrubs, mosses, and tree materials,</b>
    consuming massive amounts up to <b>400-500 lbs daily</b> and spending most of their day foraging in the
   <b>Cold Steppe ecosystem.</b> Their complex stomach and ridged molars helped them digest these <b>fibrous
    plants</b>, with <b>diet</b> varying by location and season.</p><br>

<h3>when did the wooly mammoth die out?</h3>

<p>Woolly mammoths largely went <b>extinct</b> on the mainland about 10,000 years ago, but isolated, relict populations survived on Russia's
Wrangel Island until approximately 4,000 years ago (around 2000–1650 B.C.). While most died out at the end of the <b>Pleistocene</b> due to 
climate change and human hunting, the last group likely succumbed to a sudden environmental event or inbreeding. Key Extinction Timeline Details:
Mainland Population: Extinct by 10,000 years ago. <b>St. Paul Island</b> (Alaska): Survived until 5,600 years ago. <b>Wrangel Island</b>
(Siberia): Last known population died out 4,000 years ago. The final extinction was likely driven by a combination of <b>habitat loss,</b> a changing climate (wetter landscape), 
and <b>limited genetic diversity in isolated population.</b></p><br>
