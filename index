    <h3>How did the species die out?</h3>
   
  <p>The Wooly Mammoth died due to <b>climate change</b> as it <b>adapted</b> 
      to the cold weathers and climate change wiped everything out and due to human hunting
      for shelter clothing and for tools also to the fact that they were
      lacking food and <b>habitat.</b></p><br>

  <h3>Diet of a Wooly Mammoth</h3>

  <p>Woolly mammoths were <b>herbivores</b> that grazed primarily on tough <b>tundra grasses and sedges,</b> 
    using their tusks to dig under snow, but also ate <b>flowering plants, shrubs, mosses, and tree materials,</b>
    consuming massive amounts up to 400-500 lbs daily and spending most of their day foraging in the
   <b>Cold Steppe ecosystem.</b> Their complex stomach and ridged molars helped them digest these <b>fibrous
    plants</b>, with <b>diet</b> varying by location and season.</p><br>

<h3>When did the wooly mammoth die out?</h3>

<p>Woolly mammoths largely went <b>extinct</b> on the mainland about 10,000 years ago, but isolated, relict populations survived on Russia's
Wrangel Island until approximately 4,000 years ago (around 2000–1650 B.C.). While most died out at the end of the <b>Pleistocene</b> due to 
climate change and human hunting, the last group likely succumbed to a sudden environmental event or inbreeding. Key Extinction Timeline Details:
Mainland Population: Extinct by 10,000 years ago. <b>St. Paul Island</b> (Alaska): Survived until 5,600 years ago. <b>Wrangel Island</b>
(Siberia): Last known population died out 4,000 years ago. The final extinction was likely driven by a combination of <b>habitat loss,</b> a 
changing climate (wetter landscape), 
and <b>limited genetic diversity<b> in isolated population.</p><br>

<h3>Glossary<h3>

<li><b> climate change:<b>A long-term shift in global or regional temperature and weather patterns. While historically natural, 
modern climate change is primarily driven by human activities like burning fossil fuels, which trap heat in the atmosphere.<br></li>


<li><b>adapted:<b> In biology, this refers to having heritable traits—physical, behavioral, or physiological—that improve an organism's 
chances of surviving and reproducing in its specific environment.<br></li>


<li><b>habitat:<b> The natural home or environment where an organism lives, providing the necessary food, water, shelter, and space it needs 
to survive.<br></li>


<li><b>herbivores:<b> Animals that anatomically and physiologically adapted to eat primarily plant-based materials rather than meat.<br></li>


<li><b>tundra grasses and sedges:<b> Low-growing, hardy plants native to the Arctic. Sedges often look like grasses but typically have triangular 
stems and can thrive in the wet, poorly drained soils characteristic of the tundra.<br></li>


<li><b>flowering plants, shrubs, mosses, and tree materials:<b> These represent the diverse vegetation layers of the tundra. Mosses and 
flowering "cushion plants" grow low to the ground to trap heat, while shrubs are often dwarfed to survive harsh winds and permafrost.<br></li>


<li><b>Cold Steppe ecosystem:<b> A vast, dry, and grass-dominated landscape that existed during past glacial periods
(like the Mammoth Steppe). It is characterized by cold temperatures and high productivity of nutritious grasses that supported
large herbivores.<br></li>


<li><b>St. Paul Island:<b> A remote island in the Bering Sea known as one of the last refuges for woolly mammoths, who 
survived there for thousands of years after mainland populations went extinct.<br></li>


<li><b>Wrangel Island:<b> An Arctic island off the coast of Siberia, famous for being the very last known location where woolly
mammoths lived (until roughly 4,000 years ago).<br></li>


<li><b>habitat loss:<b> The process by which a natural habitat is rendered unable to support the species present. 
This can occur through actual destruction, fragmentation (breaking it into smaller pieces), or degradation.<br></li>
